# Smart Start Software
Smart start is a demo project designed to advise entrepreneurs on how to start or improve their business. At this link you can see a demo project that was my graduate work at the High School of Information Technology. The project and the idea itself were protected in the Intellectual Property Office, where the employees assessed it as an exceptional improvement of the existing system and as such the system is unique in the Balkans. The program participated in the competition for the best technological innovation and took a high place, placing in the last round of selection of innovative ideas.
